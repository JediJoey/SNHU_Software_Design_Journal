This is where I am storing my Software Design Project for my Operating Systems class at SNHU.
-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I was very thourough in my reccomendation section.  I think I took all of their requirements into account when designing a system that would fit they're needs.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It gave me a reference, or a high level map to call back to when trying to see the big picture through the weeds of development.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably add a section for development reccomendations in regards to the project team.  I may recommend they utilize agile with a product owner, developers, testers, and MAYBE a scrum master depending on their org structure.  That is just as important as the system design for the success of their project, although that advice may fall on deaf ears.  I would also reccomend using a CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development cycle.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ultimately, people use computers.  They are a tool for people.  If people can't use the tools you design correctly, then they are poor tools.  This is why requirements are essential in development cycle.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I think it is a fools game to try to design everything right out of the gate.  It is also a fools game to go into the abyss without a map.  The good path lies somewhere in the middle.  Explore the system before reccomending it.  Have a plan, but adaptation is what makes the true difference.
